This project was built around three major components: a login/submission web page, an algorithm that scrapes data from the playlist and finds the two videos from the list, and a newsletter web page constructed from the two videosâ€™ data. Both web pages were constructed using Flask (Python/HTML) and a small bit of JavaScript, and the algorithm was built in Python
